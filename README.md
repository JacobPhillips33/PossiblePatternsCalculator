# Possible Patterns Calculator

C# Console Application

This application will calculate the number of patterns possible on a 3x3 grid given the starting point and the number of movements in the pattern. 

Rules:
1.	Grid points will not be repeated; they can only be used once, at most.
2.	Patterns will not pass through a point unless it has already been used. For example: Cannot go from A -> G unless D has already been used.

Solution example: Making 3 moves beginning with grid point A has 31 possible patterns.

Grid:

A      B      C

D      E      F

G      H      I
